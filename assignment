Build a timeline visualization of data contained in Silk.

Silk sites contain data with inferred types. One of these types is
'date'. However, currently no visualizations use this data. Your task
is to build a timeline visualization. It should plot pages (or some
data about them) on a timeline, using a tag with type 'date' of those
pages to order them.

To get the data, you can use the query function provided in the API.
The easiest way to figure out how this works, is to use a browser's
developer tools to inspect the requests the explore mode (click in the
textbox at the top of a site, then choose one of the 'explore' links).

The 'world.silkapp.com' site is an example of a site that has a date
value. For example, 'Person' pages have a 'birthdate' tag. However,
don't hardcode your visualization to a single site or tag.

You're free to choose any publicly available timeline component, or
build one yourself.

The visualization should run in a browser. However, because of cross
domain ajax limitations, you will also have to build a small backend
to make the requests to the Silk API. You can do this in any language
you prefer.

During the whole process, I'd like to do a couple of parts together. I
think finding out how the query API works and how the results look is
good for this. Afterwards, we'll discuss what works for you and me
time-wise.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask me (Erik,
